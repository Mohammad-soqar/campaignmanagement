## üéØ Getting Started (Human-Friendly)

### For Managers (the people running campaigns)

1. **Create your manager account**
   - Open the app and click **Register**.
   - Enter your display name + email + password.  
   - You‚Äôll land in your dashboard as a **Manager**.

2. **Add influencers to your roster**
   - Go to **Influencers**.
   - Click **Add Influencer**, fill in their basic details (platform, handle, profile URL, follower count, engagement rate, optional avatar, and contact email).
   - After saving, you can generate an **Onboarding Link** for that influencer:
     - Click **Create link** on the influencer card.
     - A unique link appears (and you can copy it).  
     - Send this link directly to the influencer (WhatsApp, email, DM ‚Äî your choice).

3. **Invite flow (what happens with the link)**
   - The **Onboarding Link** lets the influencer set a password and activate their account.
   - Because you created the roster and issued the invite, they‚Äôre **approved automatically**.
   - No extra approval step is needed; they can log in right away.

4. **Create a campaign**
   - Go to **Campaigns** ‚Üí **Create**.
   - Give it a title, description (optional), budget, and start/end dates.

5. **Assign influencers to a campaign**
   - Open the campaign details page.
   - Use the **Select influencer** dropdown to add people from your roster.
   - They‚Äôre now officially **assigned** to that campaign.

---

### For Influencers (the people receiving invites)

1. **Get your invite link**
   - Your manager will send you a unique **Onboarding Link**.

2. **Set your password**
   - Open the link, confirm your email (pre-filled), and choose a password.
   - Your account is created and **approved** automatically.

3. **Log in**
   - Go to the app‚Äôs **Login** page and sign in with your email + password.

4. **See your campaigns**
   - Open **My Campaigns** to view all campaigns you‚Äôve been assigned to:
     - See the title, dates, and description.
     - If something‚Äôs missing, contact your manager.

### Quick Tips
- **Managers** control the roster and campaigns.  
- **Influencers** only see campaigns assigned to them.  
- The **Onboarding Link** is one-time and time-limited. If it expires, managers can generate a new one.  
- Editing influencer details (handle, followers, etc.) is done by the **Manager** in the roster.
